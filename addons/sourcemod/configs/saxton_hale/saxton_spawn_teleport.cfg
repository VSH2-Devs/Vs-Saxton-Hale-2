// List of maps in which the boss gets teleported back to spawn if he takes damage from the map (via trigger_hurt).
// The boss can only teleport to his own spawn for the first 60 seconds (1 minute).
// After that he teleports to any spawn.
// HHH Teleports to spawns regardless of these settings, but only if the trigger_hurt does more than 250 damage.
// If this causes problems on any maps, please post about it here:

// You can specify a prefix like ph_ or koth_ or vsh_ if you want, but this is not recommended.
// You cannot specify "all" because that will cause problems on maps like vsh_megaman6_b5d.
